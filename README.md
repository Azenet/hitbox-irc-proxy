# hitbox-irc-proxy
IRC proxy for Hitbox.tv

Right now, the project is still pretty bare bones and in alpha state.

Usage:
````
python hitbox-irc.py
````

Connect to your local machine with your favorite IRC client - nick must be your Hitbox username, and server password must be your Hitbox password.

Right now, only joins and messages work, but more is coming very soon.
